This my mail order project for Toyota Uganda. This system allows the user to determine how much they need to pay when ordering spare parts taking into account the shipping methods used and the town they are ordering from.

The system is accessable by registsred users who need to first login to use it. Account details for each registsred user is captured and stored in the database.

Details of orders are also captured and stored in the database.
